# Shared-eye-movement-code
This contains commented scripts for eye movement analysis that is used in Miriam Spering's Oculomotor lab at UBC. 

Eye movement analysis includes algorithms to detect smooth pursuit and saccade onsets and analyze various measures of oculomotor behaviour.
These scripts were and are developed in house and are mostly passed on to lab memebers. However, we are happy to share analysis scripts with
other researchers interested in eye movements. 

Please get in touch with our lab http://www.visualcognition.ca/spering/people.html or contact one of the contributors if you want to lear more.
